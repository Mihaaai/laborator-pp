## Header and source files

Help by making code more modular and exposing just the functions you want to expose.
When working with header and source files, there are certain rules that you need to keep in mind:

+ Write in a header the function's declarations, and in a source file the function's implementation
+ Include a header file anywhere you need its content

And here are some useful tips : 
+ Declare structs and define constants in a header, so you can use them with ease in many source files
+ Including a source file in another could lead to "Multiple declarations error"
